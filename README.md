# Augmented-Storytelling: : A HoloLens Approach

=================================================================================

Transmedia storytelling is the art of telling a story across multiple media and preferably with a degree of audience participation, interaction or collaboration.

Modules: **Image Recognition, Metadata, HoloLens**
* Image Recognition is accomplished by a modified version of Vuforia SDK. These models are then connected to the Vuforia Image Recognition module using Microsoft’s C# and packaged using Visual Studio.
* The App contacts the server and fetches related metadata for the print media content. An indication is given to the user stating that the metadata has been fetched and ready for the user’s consumption. 
* The models required for the HoloLens were developed using the Unity Game Engine.
